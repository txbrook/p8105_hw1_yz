# Problem 1

Load the penguins database.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The dataset has the following variables.

    ## [1] "species"           "island"            "bill_length_mm"   
    ## [4] "bill_depth_mm"     "flipper_length_mm" "body_mass_g"      
    ## [7] "sex"               "year"

This dataset includes information of Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo three
species of penguins, their location of Biscoe, Dream or Torgersen. Their
bill length ,bill depth, flipper length, body mass,sex and year.

The dataset have 8 columns and 344 rows. the mean flipper length is
200.9152047.

A scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x) and export
to project directory.

``` r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() + labs(x = "Bill Length(mm)", y = "flipper length(mm)") +
  ggtitle("Scatter plot of Bill Length and flipper length")
```

# Problem 2

Create a data frame

``` r
  df = tibble(
             sample = rnorm(10),
             vec_logical = sample > 0,
             vec_character = c('a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','j'),
             vec_factor = factor(c("x","x","y","z","x","y","z","z","y","y"))
  )
```

The mean of each variable in dataframe.

``` r
  print(mean(pull(df, sample)))
```

    ## [1] 0.08244238

``` r
  print(mean(pull(df, vec_logical)))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
  print(mean(pull(df, vec_character)))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
  print(mean(pull(df, vec_factor)))
```

    ## [1] NA

The mean function mean() works on the numeric vector and logical vector.
But, it cannot work on character vector and factor vector.

Convert variables

``` r
  as.numeric(pull(df, vec_logical))
  as.numeric(pull(df, vec_character))
  as.numeric(pull(df, vec_factor))
```

as.numeric can convert logical vector to numeric values 1 or 0 and
factor vector to numeric values according to their level. However,
character vector is converted to NA.

This explains what happened when I take the mean. mean() can convert
logic value and numeric value to numbers to operate. mean() cannot
convert factor value directly to numeric value, so it cannot return mean
for factor vector.
